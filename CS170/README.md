# CS170 Projects

There are two projects for this class.

## Project 1: The Eight-Puzzle Game

**What is an 8 Puzzle?**

An 8 puzzle is a simple game consisting of a 3 x 3 grid (containing 9 squares). One of the squares is empty. The object is to move to squares around into different positions and having the numbers displayed in the "goal state".

For this project, we will write a program that solves the eight-puzzle using:
1) Uniform Cost Search
2) A* with the Misplaced Tile heuristic
3) A* with the Manhattan Distance heuristic

For more details, can check the project description.

## Project 2: Feature Selection with KNN

**What is KNN?**

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) is a simple way to classify things by looking at whatâ€™s nearby.

For this program, we will use KNN to perform feature selection by using two methods:
1) Forward Selection
2) Backward Elimination
